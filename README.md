# 🎬 MovieSite

MovieSite is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse movies, view detailed information, and interact with a backend REST API connected to a MongoDB database.

This project demonstrates full-stack development using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, with a NoSQL database for data persistence.

---

## 🚀 Overview

MovieSite is designed with a clean separation between frontend and backend services:

- The **React frontend** handles UI rendering, state management, and API requests.
- The **Spring Boot backend** exposes RESTful endpoints for retrieving and managing movie data.
- **MongoDB** stores movie and review data.

This architecture reflects a real-world full-stack application structure.

## 🏗 Architecture

MovieSite follows a standard three-tier architecture:

### 1️⃣ Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- Built with React
- Fetches data from backend using HTTP requests
- Manages UI state and rendering

### 2️⃣ Application Layer (Backend)
- Spring Boot REST controllers
- Service layer for business logic
- Repository layer for database interaction

### 3️⃣ Data Layer (Database)
- MongoDB collections store movie and review data
- Documents structured for flexible schema design

This separation ensures scalability, maintainability, and clean code organization.
